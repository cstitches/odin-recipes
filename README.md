Culminating project of the HTML Foundations sections of The Odin Project's Foundations path.

Will build a website consisting of a main index page with links to a few recipes. Will revisit later in the curriculum to style with CSS.

This project will demonstrate ability to work with basic HTML to create a website, while using Git for version control and GitHub for remote backup and sharing.
