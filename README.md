Culminating project of the HTML Foundations sections of The Odin Project's Foundations path.

Built a website consisting of a main index page with links to a few recipes. Revisited during CSS Foundations to add basic styling for colors and typography.

This project demonstrates ability to work with basic HTML and CSS to create a website, while using Git for version control and GitHub for remote backup and sharing.
